# Instacart_Basket_Analysis-Python
The goal of this project is to provide analysis that would drive sales for Instacart, an online grocery store.
Instacart item order data is hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/psparks/instacart-market-basket-analysis).  This is used in conjunction with generated fictitious customer dataset to create a final dataset which contains 32+ million rows of customer order data.

Python is used in all steps of the project; from data cleaning and wrangling, data exploration, feature engineering, analysis, and visualization. The main libraries used is pandas and numpy for data cleaning and analysis, and matplotlib and seaborn for visualization.

## Objective
Provide support to the sales and marketing teams at Instacart by extracting insights and suggesting stratigies that will drive sales with a particular intrest in customer segmentation and how to effectively target certain groups for marketing plans.  The teams execpt an easy to understand Excel report.

## Key Questions
- The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
- The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the
 day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at
 times when there are fewer orders.
- They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people
 spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
 these times.
- Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
 use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
 and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
 product orders.
- The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
 customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
  - What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how
 often do they return to Instacart)?
  - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
  - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
  - Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering
 habits?
  - What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?
 Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
  - What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer
 profiles?
